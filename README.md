Weather Forecast

This is a weather forecast app.
Start typing the desired city and you will be presented with options in the list.

Each weather mode has a unique background and is updated when you enter a new city.

In this project I use React, ReactBootstrap and css.

The weather data is retrieved using axios from https://openweathermap.org/api.

I hope you enjoy the weather!
